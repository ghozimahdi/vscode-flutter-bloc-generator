### Template Examples

#### Fixed State Template (v1.0.0+):

```dart
@freezed
abstract class GetUserState with _$GetUserState {
  const factory GetUserState.idle() = UserIdleState;
  const factory GetUserState.loading() = UserLoadingState;
  const factory GetUserState.error() = UserErrorState;
  const factory GetUserState.done() = UserDoneState;
}
```

#### Broken State Template (v0.0.8 and below - CAUSES FREEZED ERROR):

```dart
@freezed
abstract class GetUserState with _$GetUserState {
  const factory GetUserState.idle() = _GetUserIdleState;  // ‚ùå This causes freezed error
  const factory GetUserState.loading() = GetUserLoadingState;
  const factory GetUserState.error() = GetUserErrorState;
  const factory GetUserState.done() = GetUserDoneState;
}
```

#### Full State Template Structure:

```dart
@freezed
class UserState with _$UserState {
  const factory UserState({
    @Default(GetUserState.idle()) GetUserState userState,
  }) = _UserState;
}

@freezed
abstract class GetUserState with _$GetUserState {
  const factory GetUserState.idle() = UserIdleState;
  const factory GetUserState.loading() = UserLoadingState;
  const factory GetUserState.error() = UserErrorState;
  const factory GetUserState.done() = UserDoneState;
}
```
